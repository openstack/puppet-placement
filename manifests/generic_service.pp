# == Define: placement::generic_service
#
# This defined type implements basic placement services.
# It is introduced to attempt to consolidate
# common code.
#
# It also allows users to specify ad-hoc services
# as needed
#
# This define creates a service resource with title placement-${name} and
# conditionally creates a package resource with title placement-${name}
#
# === Parameters:
#
# [*package_name*]
#   (Required) The package name (for the generic_service)
#
# [*service_name*]
#   (Required) The service name (for the generic_service)
#
# [*enabled*]
#   (Optional) Define if the service must be enabled or not
#   Defaults to false.
#
# [*manage_service*]
#   (Optional) Manage or not the service (if a service_name is provided).
#   Defaults to true.
#
# [*ensure_package*]
#   (Optional) Control the ensure parameter for the package resource.
#   Defaults to 'present'.
